# Shopping List App

This is a simple shopping list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses Firebase Realtime Database to store the shopping list items and Vite for a build tool. The app is also configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA), which means it can be installed on supported devices for offline use.
